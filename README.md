A simple plugin that adds functionality for Command Blocks to remove armour of a player.

Syntax is /removearmour [Player] (The player can have a part spelt name, for example if my username was Wundark I could have the command as /removearmour Wun)

Permission node:
- removearmour.use ~ Allows for the usage of the command.
